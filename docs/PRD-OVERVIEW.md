## Product Overview

### What is gonuget?

gonuget is a comprehensive, production-grade NuGet client library written in Go. It provides complete protocol implementation for interacting with NuGet package feeds, enabling Go applications to search, download, install, and manage NuGet packages without requiring the .NET runtime.

### Problem Statement

Organizations building DevOps tooling, security scanners, artifact management systems, and cloud infrastructure in Go face a critical gap: there is no complete, production-ready NuGet client library for Go. Current approaches require:

- **Shelling out to .NET CLI tools** - Slow, heavy, requires .NET runtime installation
- **Partial protocol reimplementation** - Fragile, incomplete, missing critical features
- **Embedding .NET runtime** - Large container images, complex deployment, performance overhead

This forces teams to either:
1. Build incomplete, fragile solutions themselves
2. Accept .NET runtime dependency and performance penalties
3. Skip NuGet integration entirely

### Solution

gonuget provides a complete, native Go implementation of the NuGet client protocol that:

- **Achieves 100% feature parity** with official C# NuGet.Client
- **Exceeds C# client performance** by 2-3x through Go's advantages
- **Requires zero external dependencies** - single binary, no runtime needed
- **Enables library integration** - import and use directly, no shelling out
- **Provides modern features** - HTTP/3, circuit breakers, structured logging, OTEL tracing

## Competitive Analysis

### Direct Competitors

**None.** There is no production-grade, complete NuGet client library for Go.

### Partial Solutions

**1. go-nuget (GitHub: ~50 stars)**
- **Status:** Abandoned (last commit 2018)
- **Features:** Basic v2 API support only
- **Limitations:** No v3, no signing, no package reading, incomplete
- **Opportunity:** gonuget replaces completely

**2. Internal implementations**
- **Examples:** Dependabot, Renovate, various tools
- **Approach:** Partial protocol reimplementation
- **Limitations:** Fragmented, incomplete, unmaintained, not reusable
- **Opportunity:** Provide shared library to eliminate duplicated effort

**3. Shell out to .NET CLI**
- **Approach:** subprocess calls to `nuget.exe`, `dotnet restore`
- **Limitations:** Slow, heavy, requires .NET runtime
- **Opportunity:** Native Go solution with better performance and no dependencies

### Comparable Solutions (Other Ecosystems)

**npm (JavaScript):**
- Multiple Go libraries exist (go-npm, etc.)
- Validates market for ecosystem-crossing clients

**Maven (Java):**
- go-maven exists for similar use cases
- Demonstrates need for cross-language tooling

**PyPI (Python):**
- Various Python package clients in Go
- Same pattern: DevOps tools need programmatic access

### Competitive Advantages

**vs Shelling Out:**
- 10-100x faster (no process spawning)
- No .NET runtime dependency
- Native error handling
- Type-safe API

**vs Partial Implementations:**
- 100% feature complete
- Professionally maintained
- Comprehensive test suite
- Well-documented

**vs C# NuGet.Client:**
- 2-3x better performance
- Modern features (HTTP/3, circuit breakers)
- Go-native (fits Go tooling ecosystem)
- Smaller deployment footprint

---

## Product Principles

### Principle 1: Protocol Fidelity

**"100% wire-compatible with official NuGet protocol"**

- Every protocol detail implemented correctly
- Pass all Microsoft protocol compliance tests
- Handle all edge cases C# client handles
- No "good enough" shortcuts

**Rationale:** Trust is everything. Incomplete implementations create bugs, confusion, and ecosystem fragmentation.

---

### Principle 2: Go-Idiomatic Design

**"Feels natural to Go developers"**

- `context.Context` first parameter on all operations
- Functional options for configuration
- Interface-based extensibility
- Standard library patterns (io.Reader, error handling)
- No "ported C# code" feel

**Rationale:** Adoption requires fitting into Go ecosystem norms. Developers should feel productive immediately.

---

### Principle 3: Performance by Default

**"Fast path is the default path"**

- Zero-allocation hot paths
- Caching built-in, not optional
- Concurrent operations by default
- No performance cliffs

**Rationale:** Performance is a feature. Users choose gonuget for speed - deliver it without configuration.

---

### Principle 4: Production-Ready Quality

**"Enterprise-grade from day one"**

- 90%+ test coverage
- Zero tolerance for data races
- No panics in library code
- Graceful degradation
- Comprehensive observability

**Rationale:** Infrastructure libraries must be bulletproof. Production outages are unacceptable.

---

### Principle 5: Fail-Safe Defaults

**"Safe by default, configurable for advanced use"**

- Signature verification enabled
- TLS verification enforced
- Rate limiting active
- Circuit breakers protecting
- Timeouts reasonable

**Rationale:** Prevent security issues and production incidents through safe defaults.

---

### Principle 6: Composable Architecture

**"Small, focused interfaces"**

- Single responsibility components
- Interface-based contracts
- No global state
- Mockable for testing
- Extensible without forking

**Rationale:** Enable users to build on gonuget without fighting the design.

---

### Principle 7: Observable by Design

**"Built-in visibility into operations"**

- Structured logging (mtlog)
- OpenTelemetry tracing
- Prometheus metrics
- Health checks
- Debug modes

**Rationale:** Production systems require observability. Build it in, don't bolt it on.

---

### Principle 8: Backward Compatible Evolution

**"Stable API, evolving features"**

- Semantic versioning strictly followed
- No breaking changes in minor/patch releases
- Deprecation warnings before removal
- Migration guides for major versions

**Rationale:** Respect users' time. API churn destroys trust and adoption.

- Automated regression testing

---

### Risk 4: Limited Adoption

**Risk:** Developer community doesn't adopt library

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Identify early adopters (Dependabot-like tools)
- Create compelling examples and tutorials
- Present at conferences (GopherCon, etc.)
- Engage with tool maintainers directly
- Offer migration assistance

---

### Risk 5: Maintenance Burden

**Risk:** Single maintainer cannot sustain long-term

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Design for minimal maintenance (good architecture)
- Comprehensive test suite (catch regressions)
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Recruit co-maintainers early
- Consider sponsorship/foundation

---

### Risk 6: Security Vulnerability

**Risk:** Critical security issue discovered post-launch

**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** Critical
**Mitigation:**
- Security-focused code review
- Automated security scanning (Dependabot, Snyk)
- Responsible disclosure policy
- Rapid patch release process
- Security contact/advisory process

---

### Risk 7: Competing Implementation

**Risk:** Someone else builds similar library first

**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Execute quickly (6-9 months to v1.0)
- Differentiate on quality and completeness
- Build community early (blog posts, talks)
- If competitor emerges, consider collaboration

---

### Risk 8: Framework Compatibility Bugs

**Risk:** Framework compatibility rules too complex, bugs in logic

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Extract exact mappings from C# implementation
- Extensive test coverage for compat rules
- Cross-validate against C# NuGet.Client results
- Community testing with real-world projects

---

### Risk 9: Resource Constraints

**Risk:** 6-9 month timeline too aggressive for single developer

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Realistic milestone planning
- MVP for v1.0 (defer nice-to-haves)
- Accept slip to 12 months if needed
- Communicate timeline transparently

---

### Risk 10: Enterprise Support Expectations

**Risk:** Enterprises want paid support before production use

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive documentation reduces support burden
- Community forum for questions
- Consider commercial support offering (future)
- Partner with established vendors (e.g., JFrog)
