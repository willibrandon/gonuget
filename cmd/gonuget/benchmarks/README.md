| Version command | <5ms | 3.05ms | ✅ **PASS** |
| Config read | <10ms | 3.06ms | ✅ **PASS** |
| Config write | <15ms | 15.88ms | ⚠️ **CLOSE** (5% over target) |

## Benchmark Results

### Phase 1 Results - Foundation Commands

**Performance Comparison: gonuget vs dotnet nuget**

| Command | gonuget | dotnet nuget | Speedup | Memory Savings |
|---------|---------|--------------|---------|----------------|
| version | ~3ms | ~110ms | **36x faster** | **94% less** (6MB vs 96MB) |
| config get | ~3ms | ~120ms | **40x faster** | **94% less** (6MB vs 96MB) |
| list source | ~3ms | ~112ms | **37x faster** | **94% less** (6MB vs 96MB) |

**Key Findings:**

1. **Startup Overhead**: dotnet nuget requires .NET runtime initialization (~100ms) on every invocation. gonuget is a native binary with zero runtime overhead.

2. **Memory Efficiency**: gonuget uses ~6MB for CLI commands vs ~96MB for dotnet nuget. The .NET runtime alone requires significant memory before any work begins.

3. **Consistent Performance**: gonuget performance is consistent across commands (2-4ms), while dotnet nuget has consistent 100-120ms overhead regardless of command complexity.

**Why is gonuget faster?**

- **Native Compilation**: Go compiles to native machine code for the target platform with no runtime initialization required
- **Zero Runtime Overhead**: No CLR startup, no JIT compilation, no assembly loading on every invocation
- **Efficient Execution**: Direct syscalls without managed runtime abstraction layers
- **Minimal Startup Work**: No telemetry initialization, first-use checks, or environment setup

## Profiling

### CPU Profiling

```bash
go test -tags=benchmark -bench=BenchmarkStartup -cpuprofile=cpu.prof ./cmd/gonuget
go tool pprof -http=:8080 cpu.prof
```

### Memory Profiling

```bash
go test -tags=benchmark -bench=BenchmarkStartup -memprofile=mem.prof ./cmd/gonuget
go tool pprof -http=:8080 mem.prof
```

### Trace Analysis

```bash
go test -tags=benchmark -bench=BenchmarkStartup -trace=trace.out ./cmd/gonuget
go tool trace trace.out
```

## Optimization Tips

1. **Startup Time**:
   - Minimize init() functions
   - Lazy-load dependencies
   - Use sync.Once for one-time initialization
   - Avoid unnecessary file I/O during startup

2. **Memory Usage**:
   - Reuse buffers with sync.Pool
   - Avoid unnecessary allocations
   - Use streaming for large files
   - Close resources explicitly

3. **Command Performance**:
   - Cache frequently accessed config
   - Batch XML writes
   - Use efficient data structures

## Future Benchmarks

### Phase 2: Package Search & Download

**Targets to benchmark:**
- Search with 100 results
- Download single 50MB package
- Download 10 packages in parallel
- Metadata fetch for 100 packages
- HTTP/2 connection efficiency

**Expected advantages:**
- Go's native goroutines for parallel downloads
- Efficient HTTP client with connection pooling
- Lower memory overhead during concurrent operations

### Phase 3: Dependency Resolution

**Targets to benchmark:**
- Resolve simple dependency (1 level deep)
- Resolve complex dependency graph (ASP.NET Core - 100+ packages)
- Conflict detection in large graphs
- Parallel resolution with worker pool
- Cache hit performance

**Expected advantages:**
- Custom walker algorithm optimized for concurrent resolution
- Operation cache to avoid duplicate work
- Efficient memory usage during graph traversal

### Phase 4: Package Installation & Restore

**Targets to benchmark:**
- Install single package
- Restore entire solution (50+ packages)
- Update all packages in project
- Reinstall with target framework change

**Expected advantages:**
- Parallel extraction and installation
- Efficient file I/O operations
- Lower memory footprint during large restores

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

**Targets to benchmark:**
- Signature verification (PKCS#7)
- Package signing operations
- Multi-source aggregation
- Cache hit vs miss performance

## Strategic Value

**Why continuous benchmarking matters:**

1. **Developer Experience**: CLI commands run hundreds of times per day. 100ms savings per command = significant productivity gains.

2. **CI/CD Performance**: Build systems run `nuget restore` frequently. Faster restore = faster builds = faster feedback loops.

3. **Resource Efficiency**: 94% memory savings × thousands of parallel CI jobs = substantial infrastructure cost savings.

4. **Competitive Advantage**: Performance is a key differentiator and justification for gonuget's existence beyond feature parity.

5. **Optimization Guidance**: Benchmarks identify which operations benefit most from Go's advantages (startup, concurrency, memory efficiency).

**Questions to answer through benchmarking:**

- Where does gonuget excel? (✅ Startup, CLI commands - **proven**)
- Where is it comparable? (TBD: Package downloads, metadata operations)
- Where might .NET be faster? (TBD: Large XML parsing, complex LINQ operations)
- What operations justify gonuget's development? (TBD: Overall workflow analysis)

## Continuous Performance Monitoring

Benchmarks should be run:
- ✅ After implementing each command (validate against targets)
- ✅ Before committing performance-sensitive code
- 📋 TODO: Automatically on each commit to track regressions
- 📋 TODO: Weekly comparison against latest `dotnet nuget`
