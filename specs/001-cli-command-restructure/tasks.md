# Tasks: CLI Command Structure Restructure

**Feature Branch**: `001-cli-command-restructure`
**Input**: Design documents from `specs/001-cli-command-restructure/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: This feature explicitly requests comprehensive testing (golden tests, reflection tests, unit tests). All test tasks are included per feature requirements.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Project uses single project structure with CLI in `cmd/gonuget/` and tests in root-level `tests/` directory (per existing gonuget structure documented in plan.md).

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic command structure

- [X] T001 Create parent command files: `cmd/gonuget/commands/package.go` and `cmd/gonuget/commands/source.go`
- [X] T002 [P] Create custom error handler in `cmd/gonuget/commands/errors.go` for verb-first pattern detection
- [X] T003 [P] Create golden test directory structure: `tests/cmd/gonuget/commands/golden/`
- [X] T004 Update `cmd/gonuget/main.go` to register parent commands and remove old flat structure

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Implement package parent command with persistent flags in `cmd/gonuget/commands/package.go`
- [X] T006 Implement source parent command with persistent flags in `cmd/gonuget/commands/source.go`
- [X] T007 Implement verb-first pattern detection logic with all 10 patterns in `cmd/gonuget/commands/errors.go`
- [X] T008 Integrate custom error handler into root command in `cmd/gonuget/cli/app.go` and `cmd/gonuget/main.go`
- [X] T009 Create reflection test framework in `tests/cmd/gonuget/commands/reflection_test.go` (validates VR-001 to VR-006)
- [X] T010 Create golden test framework with update flag support in `tests/cmd/gonuget/commands/golden_test.go`

**Checkpoint**: ✅ Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 and US2 (P1 priority) can proceed in parallel after Foundational
  - US3 and US4 (P2 priority) can proceed in parallel after Foundational
  - US5 (P3 priority) can proceed after Foundational
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (Package Commands - P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Source Commands - P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (Error Messages - P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Benefits from US1/US2 commands existing but can implement independently
- **User Story 4 (JSON Output - P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1/US2 commands but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (Shell Completion - P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Complements all commands but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (per spec requirement)
- Golden test fixtures before command implementation
- Parent command registration before subcommand implementation
- Subcommand implementation before integration
- Reflection tests validate structure after implementation
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T001-T004 can all run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T005-T010 have some dependencies:
- T005, T006, T007 can run in parallel (different files)
- T008 depends on T005, T006, T007
- T009, T010 can run in parallel after T008

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- T011-T019 (all golden fixtures and unit tests) can run in parallel
- T021, T022, T023 can run in parallel (different files)
- T028, T029 can run in parallel

**Phase 4 (US2)**:
- T032-T044 (all golden fixtures and unit tests) can run in parallel
- T046-T050 can run in parallel (different files, renaming operations)

**Phase 5 (US3)**:
- T062-T071 can run in parallel (different error patterns in same file, but logically independent)

**Phase 6 (US4)**:
- T075-T078 can run in parallel (different test files)
- T079, T080, T081 can run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 7 (US5)**:
- T085-T087 can run in parallel (different test files)
- T088, T089, T090 can run in parallel (different command files)
- T092, T093, T094 can run in parallel (different completion files)

**Phase 8 (Polish)**:
- T096, T097, T101 can run in parallel (different documentation files)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only - Both P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T010) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Package Commands (T011-T031)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Source Commands (T032-T059)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both user stories independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready - Core noun-first command structure complete

This gives you the essential CLI restructure with all primary commands (package and source) working with noun-first syntax.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (Phases 1-2) → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Package Commands) → Test independently → MVP partial delivery
3. Add User Story 2 (Source Commands) → Test independently → **Core MVP complete** ✅
4. Add User Story 3 (Error Messages) → Test independently → Enhanced migration UX
5. Add User Story 4 (JSON Output) → Test independently → Automation-friendly
6. Add User Story 5 (Shell Completion) → Test independently → Full feature complete
7. Polish (Phase 8) → Production-ready

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (Phases 1-2)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Package Commands) - T011-T031
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Source Commands) - T032-T059
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Error Messages) - T060-T074
3. After US1/US2 complete:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 4 (JSON Output) - T075-T084
   - **Developer B**: User Story 5 (Shell Completion) - T085-T095
4. Team completes Polish together (Phase 8)

Stories complete and integrate independently with clear checkpoints.

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, safe for parallel execution
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Tests written first, must fail before implementation (TDD per spec requirement)
- Commit after each task or logical group using `feat(cli):` prefix (per constitution)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Golden tests updated with `-update` flag when help text intentionally changes
- Reflection tests automatically validate VR-001 to VR-006 (command structure policy)
- All tasks follow quickstart.md patterns documented in design artifacts
