- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec focuses entirely on WHAT users need and WHY, without mentioning Cobra, Go, or specific code structures. References to Cobra in requirements are acceptable as they describe behavior (error handling patterns), not implementation.

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly state the value proposition (consistency with modern CLI tools, migration friction reduction, automation enablement, productivity improvement).

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written in plain language that business stakeholders can understand. Technical terms (JSON, shell completion) are explained in context.

✅ **All mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, and Scope are all thoroughly documented.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No clarification markers**: All requirements are fully specified with concrete details. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Every functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-035) is verifiable with specific actions and expected outcomes.

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 15 success criteria include specific metrics (100% success rate, <50ms response, 5 top-level commands, etc.).

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes (command execution success, error message timing, help output) rather than internal system metrics.

✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each user story has 3-5 acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format that cover happy paths and error cases.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 7 edge cases documented covering unknown commands, typos, empty results, permissions, help text formatting, and completion fallback.

✅ **Scope bounded**: In Scope (12 items) and Out of Scope (10 items) clearly delineate what will and won't be done.

✅ **Dependencies documented**: Internal dependencies (Cobra, existing commands, core packages) and external dependencies (NuGet.config, project files, shells) all listed.

✅ **Assumptions documented**: 14 assumptions covering user familiarity, file formats, performance expectations, and project policies.

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Requirements have acceptance criteria**: All 35 functional requirements are testable and many reference corresponding acceptance scenarios in user stories.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 5 prioritized user stories (P1: package commands, P1: source commands, P2: error messages, P2: JSON output, P3: shell completion) cover all major user interactions.

✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: Success Criteria section provides 15 specific, measurable outcomes split between technical metrics (SC-001 to SC-010) and user experience outcomes (SC-011 to SC-015).

✅ **No implementation leakage**: The spec describes command structure, behavior, and user experience without prescribing how to implement it. References to Cobra behavior patterns (SuggestionsMinimumDistance, SilenceErrors) describe required behavior, not implementation approach.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED - Ready for Planning**

This specification is complete, well-structured, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`. All quality criteria are met:

- **Complete coverage**: 5 user stories with 19 acceptance scenarios, 35 functional requirements, 15 success criteria
- **Clear prioritization**: P1 (package + source commands), P2 (migration UX + automation), P3 (shell completion)
- **Technology-agnostic**: Focuses on user needs and measurable outcomes without implementation details
- **Testable**: Every requirement and success criterion is verifiable
- **Well-scoped**: Clear boundaries for what's in and out of scope
- **Production-ready**: Includes edge cases, dependencies, assumptions, and explicit policy decisions

**Recommended next steps**:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
2. Generate tasks with `/speckit.tasks` after planning is complete
