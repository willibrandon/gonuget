# Specification Quality Checklist: C# Interop Tests for Restore Transitive Dependencies

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- Specification focuses on what tests must validate (parity, categorization, error messages, lock file format)
- Written from developer and end-user perspective (gonuget developer needs confidence, .NET developer needs working builds)
- No technology-specific implementation details (no mention of Go, C#, specific test frameworks)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are specific and clear
- All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) are testable:
  - FR-001: Execute and compare results (binary pass/fail)
  - FR-002: Verify package resolution matches (enumerable, comparable)
  - FR-003: Validate categorization (binary comparison of direct/transitive flags)
  - FR-004: Verify error messages match (string comparison)
  - FR-005-FR-006: Validate JSON structure (deserializable, comparable)
  - FR-007: Use existing infrastructure (verifiable by code inspection)
  - FR-008: Achieve 90% coverage (measurable via coverage tools)
  - FR-009: Include test cases at complexity levels (countable test cases)
  - FR-010: Validate casing (string comparison)
- Success criteria all measurable:
  - SC-001: 100% pass rate (percentage)
  - SC-002: 90% coverage (percentage)
  - SC-003: Identical output (binary pass/fail)
  - SC-004: 100% build success (percentage)
  - SC-005: Under 2 minutes (time)
  - SC-006: Zero regressions (count)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of Go, C#, specific tools)
- All four user stories have acceptance scenarios (3 each)
- Edge cases identified (5 scenarios covering version conflicts, delisted packages, platform variations, cycles, large trees)
- Scope clearly bounded via "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies and assumptions explicitly listed

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- All 10 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios across 4 user stories
- User scenarios cover all critical flows:
  - P1: Transitive resolution parity (core functionality)
  - P1: Direct vs transitive categorization (data accuracy)
  - P2: Error message parity (user experience)
  - P1: Lock file compatibility (MSBuild integration)
- Measurable outcomes align with user stories:
  - SC-001/SC-002 validate Story 1 (resolution parity)
  - SC-003 validates Story 3 (error messages)
  - SC-004 validates Story 4 (lock file compatibility)
  - SC-005/SC-006 ensure test suite quality
- No implementation details present - specification focuses on what must be validated, not how to implement tests

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

Key strengths:
1. Clear measurable outcomes with specific percentages and thresholds
2. Four well-defined user stories with proper prioritization
3. Comprehensive functional requirements covering all aspects of NuGet.Client parity validation
4. Realistic assumptions about existing infrastructure (GonugetBridge, gonuget-interop-test)
5. Proper scoping via Out of Scope section to avoid scope creep

No issues found. Ready to proceed.
